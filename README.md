Fluid Baker
==========

Fluid Baker is a Blender addon, it allows particle fluid surface baking (metaballs, cubsurfer meshes) for a faster viewport and support of multiple modifiers on top of the fluid surface for more flexibility.
This Github version is free. If you enjoy this tool, please support the dev by buying on [GumRoad](https://gumroad.com/products/wdPr) :)
